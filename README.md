OpenRAND is a C++ library designed to foster reproducible scientific research by providing a robust and replicable random number generation solution. It is a simple header only library that is performance portable, statistically robust, and easy to integrate into any HPC computing project.

## Features
**Cross-Platform Support**: OpenRAND is designed to work seamlessly across various platforms, including CPUs and GPUs. Its header-only library design allows it to be easily integrated into your project.

**User-Friendly API**: OpenRAND provides a user-friendly API, making it straightforward to generate random numbers in your applications.

**Statistical Robustness**: Built-in tests ensure that random number streams generated by OpenRAND are statistically robust, with no discernible patterns.

**Performance**: It is as fast and often faster than native libraries like libstdc++ or Nvidia's Curand, with minimal memory overhead.


## Installation
OpenRAND is header only, so there is no need to install it. Simply copy the header files in `include/` directory into your project and you're good to go!

You can also install OpenRAND using CMake. To integrate OpenRAND into your CMake project, add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:

```
EDIT THIS STUFF FOR NEW URL

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  crng
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Shihab-Shahriar/rnd.git
  GIT_TAG        main
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(crng)
```


## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to generate random numbers using OpenRAND:

```
#include "OpenRAND/random.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    OpenRAND::RandomEngine rng;

    // Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
    int random_number = rng.randint(1, 100);

    std::cout << "Random Number: " << random_number << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
